Ex1: P_2 in pure CFG notation:

# stmt : (simple_stmt | if_stmt | for_stmt) NEWLINE

# simple_stmt : "print" expr ("," expr)*
# 			| name "=" expr

# if_stmt : "if" expr ":" (simple_stmts | suite)
# for_stmt : "for" name "in" "range" "(" expr ")" ":" (simple_stmts | suite)

# simple_stmts : simple_stmt (";" simple_stmt)+
# suite : NEWLINE INDENT stmt+ DEDENT

# expr : name
# 		| decint
# 		| "-" expr
#		| expr "+" expr
# 		| "(" expr ")"
#		| expr "if" expr "else" expr
#		| expr "and" expr
#		| expr "or" expr
#		| "not" expr
#		| expr (comp_op expr)+
#		| "True"
#		| "False"
#		| expr "if" expr "else" expr

# comp_op : '<' | '>' | '==' | '>=' | '<=' | '<>' | '!='

Ex2: What difficulties did you encounter?

This assignment is much difficut than two homewords before. I have encountered to 
do comparsion, assign, if statment and expression, and so on. When I try to solve 
each problem, it always shows solving this problem and then it doesn't satisfy another
problem. The most difficut thing is to implement comparsion. 

Ex2a: How was INDENT/DEDENT implemented?

There is an example supporting that. I don't need to worry about it.

Ex2b: [EXTRA CREDIT] Any smarter way for the above than what I put on the slides?


Ex3: What difficulties did you encounter?

precedure of each token. find out each expression's and statement's path in recursion.

     Any comments on PLY?
